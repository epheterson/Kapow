**Test suite + git hooks infrastructure.**
- Added Vitest test suite: 133 tests across 7 modules (deck, hand, triad, scoring, rules, gameState, ai)

- Shared `hooks/` directory — Chuck runs `git config core.hooksPath hooks` once
- CHANGELOG.md backfilled with full project history from initial commit
- PLAN.md updated with AI improvement roadmap

### 02-23-2026 v2

- Powerset value display redesigned — modifiers shown on card face

- Buy CTAs suppressed once player has given their email

### 02-22-2026 v3
**Feedback via Google Form (replaces mailto).**
- Feedback modal submits to Google Form instead of opening mail client
- Includes game log and device context automatically

### 02-22-2026 v2
**Game save/resume + feedback flow.**

### 02-22-2026 v1
**Buy funnel, email capture, rename AI → Kai, dopamine hits.**
- Buy modal with email capture form
- AI opponent renamed to "Kai" throughout UI
- Big "Start Game" button with breathing glow animation
- Scorecard: notes, share (Web Share API), version tag, tap-to-close
- Desktop layout width constraints, message capped at 480px

### 02-21-2026 v7
**Fix desktop piles tucked in: replaced CSS grid with flex+center on play-area.**
- `grid-template-columns: auto 1fr auto` made center column claim full viewport width, pushing piles to screen edges
- New: `display: flex; justify-content: center` — piles sit directly adjacent to cards
- `#center-strip` uses `align-self: stretch` to lock width to hand-grid

### 02-21-2026 v6
**Fix desktop vertical spacing: remove artificial spreading between hands and center strip.**
- Card formula overhead increased 165px → 280px to account for center strip + headers
- Removed fixed height from hands-column, removed `flex: 1` from center-strip
- Cards top out at ~103px on 900px viewports (still reach 130px at ≥1060px)

### 02-21-2026 v5
**Fix desktop center strip button layout: each element on its own row.**
- Message, action buttons (Hint + End Turn), and Understand AI's Move each occupy a full-width row
- `flex: 0 0 100%` enforces single-row-per-element — no horizontal shifting

### 02-21-2026 v4
**Fix piles shifting horizontally and version to footer center.**
- CSS grid (`auto 1fr auto`) locks piles in fixed columns
- Center strip uses `width: fit-content; margin: auto`
- Revision footer moved from bottom-right to bottom-center

### 02-21-2026 v3
**Stack center strip vertically: message on its own row, buttons below.**
- `flex-wrap: wrap` on center-strip, `flex: 0 0 100%` on game-message

### 02-21-2026 v2
**Fix desktop card overflow: viewport-height-based card sizing.**
- Formula: `clamp(68px, (100vh - 165px) / 6, 130px)` — 6 card rows fill available height
- Card width derives from height at fixed 100:140 aspect ratio
- Renamed VERSION_LOG.md → CHANGELOG.md

### 02-21-2026 v1
**Merged Eric's fork: mobile UI, sounds, animations, tutorial, PWA, bug fixes.**
- Mobile-first responsive layout (CSS grid, svh/dvh units, iOS Safari viewport lock)
- PWA / iOS home screen app (manifest.json, service worker, Apple meta tags)
- Sound effects via Web Audio API (flip, draw, place, triad chime, KAPOW hit, round/game end)
- Card animations (3D flip on reveal, slide-in on placement, screen shake on triad, KAPOW glow)
- Interactive tutorial — first game uses stacked deck with coaching messages; replayable from Help
- "How to Play" modal with 5 tabs (Basics, Cards, Turns, Scoring, Tips) + YouTube link
- Hint button — AI-powered best-move suggestion
- "Understand AI's Move" lightbulb tips — contextual strategic insights in explanation modal

- AI deadlock fix: empty draw + discard pile no longer silently freezes the game
- Scoring null guard: applyFirstOutPenalty no longer crashes when nobody went out
- Doubling penalty explanation on round-end screen
- Also merged Chuck's AI fixes: going-out-via-triad-completion detection,
  matched-pair destruction penalty, stronger discard safety (0.4× → 1.0×),
  draw-from-discard going-out guard

### 02-20-2026 v3
**Fixed AI explanation to avoid nonsensical future completion paths when going out.**
- Explanation now focuses on going-out decision when placement triggers going out
- Clarifies why timing was right to end the round

### 02-20-2026 v2
**Strengthened discard safety penalty for opponent-completion cards.**
- Scaling factor for replaced-card discard penalty from 0.4 → 1.0
- Penalty directly proportional to danger level (stronger deterrent)
