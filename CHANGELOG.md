*Unified timeline. Entries tagged `[Eric]` or `[Chuck]` to indicate contributor. Version numbers are sequential per date across both contributors.*

## Version History

### 02-25-2026

**v17 [Eric]** Desktop UX & card redesign — Chuck's feedback.
- Card redesign: removed physical-card corner values from Fixed cards; center-top type label + large center value
- Power cards: modifiers now flank "Power" label in header row instead of bottom position
- Powerset on-card display: top card shows "Powerset" label + effective value (= N) below face value
- Desktop font sizes: game message 11px → 14px, action buttons → 13px, pile labels → 12px
- Fuzzy text fix: removed backdrop-filter blur on desktop game message, added GPU compositing hints
- Center strip: message stacked above buttons (not inline), fixed 320px width prevents card deck bouncing
- Desktop play area vertically centered in viewport
- Help button (?) restyled: larger, cleaner border, removed backdrop blur
- AI → Kai: all user-facing game messages and "Understand Move" explanations now say "Kai" instead of "AI"
- Mobile center strip: fixed height prevents button growth from shifting card hands
- Round-end screen: shows winner announcement ("You win the round!" / "Kai wins!" / "Tie!") with colored text
- Telemetry: on by default (was opt-in, blocking all data collection)
- Privacy: replaced consent banner with footer/scorecard "Privacy" link → modal with opt-out button
- Fix: discard pile cards now render with same layout as hand cards (was still using old corner-value style)
- Fix: removed "=" prefix from powerset effective value display
- Fix: clear Kai's card highlight when round ends (green highlight no longer persists into round-end screen)
- Fix: power card modifiers clipping on iOS (clamped font size, overflow hidden)
- Font fallback: Impact/Arial Black before Bangers loads (closer match than default cursive)
- Footer reordered: Feedback · Privacy · Get the Card Game
- Privacy modal text simplified
- Scorecard Share/Leaderboard row matched to full width
- Mobile score bar: visual separators between groups
- Desktop footer hidden on short viewports (< 700px height) to prevent overlap with cards
- iOS landscape: enabled vertical scrolling so game is accessible in landscape orientation
- Power card face value moved to bottom of card (balances against Power header at top, saves vertical space)
- Privacy modal: concise, honest text about data collection
- Pre-commit hook: version bump now compares against origin/main to avoid conflicts between contributors
- Fix: revert Fixed card face value back to centered (bottom positioning was worse)
- Power card face value padding increased for more breathing room
- "Understand Kai's Move" button toned down (no longer bright blue pulsing glow, matches other button style)
- Desktop footer hidden at viewport heights under 920px to prevent overlapping cards

**v16 [Eric]** Telemetry system, analytics dashboard, scoreboard UX fix.
- Game telemetry (telemetry.js): anonymous stats collection via Google Form → Sheet pipeline, player consent flow, abandonment tracking, GA4 events
- Analytics dashboard (dashboard.html): live data via Apps Script API, Chart.js charts, 8 stat cards, recent games table, manual import feature
- Scoreboard close fix: defined missing `closeSidebar()`, tap-anywhere-to-close on mobile overlay, improved X button visibility
- Privacy consent banner for telemetry opt-in
- Feedback modal with game log auto-capture

### 02-24-2026

**v20 [Eric]** Unified changelog — merged VERSION_LOG.md into CHANGELOG.md with `[Eric]`/`[Chuck]` tags.

**v19 [Eric]** Fix CSS regression from dad's merge. Restored full desktop layout + UI styling; surgically applied Chuck's two CSS fixes (powerset label position/color, modifier overlap).

**v18 [Eric]** Integrated Chuck's AI strategy overhaul (batch 2).
- Steeper discard safety formula (two-segment) — prevents AI gifting triad-completing cards
- KAPOW-swap completion lookahead: AI recognizes placements that complete via one swap
- KAPOW-aware `aiCountFutureCompletions` for 3-revealed triads with KAPOW
- KAPOW burial bonus in powerset opportunity scoring
- Top-position penalty exempted when placement completes triad
- Single within-triad swap (no loop) — simplified `aiStepWithinTriadSwap`
- Human swap validates triad stays complete before executing
- Discard animation after within-triad swap completion
- AI hang fix: clear `aiTurnInProgress` in `completeWithinTriadSwap`
- Power card modifier overlap fix (CSS)
- Powerset value label shown on Power cards

**v17 [Eric]** Integrated Chuck's AI improvements (PR #1).
- AI can now perform within-triad KAPOW swaps (previously human-only)
- KAPOW detection handles powersets (KAPOW + Power modifier pairs), not just solo KAPOWs
- Added debug logging for AI decision candidates and chosen actions
- Updated `swapKapowCard`, `hasRevealedKapow`, `aiStepWithinTriadSwap` for powerset awareness

**v16 [Eric]** Desktop layout fix.
- Fixed desktop vertical overflow — replaced 146px center strip with compact inline control bar (zero scroll at 820px)
- Hidden redundant section headers and triad labels on desktop, reclaiming ~216px vertical space
- Card height formula now precisely accounts for triad padding, gaps, and borders
- Bumped service worker cache (v48→v49)

**v15 [Chuck]** Fix: KAPOW-swap completion bonus unfairly inflated vs direct completion.
- Bug: `kapowSwapExistingPoints` summed ALL 3 triad positions including the placed slot. For a placed KAPOW (value=25), this added 25 to the bonus, making the swap path score higher than a direct completion at a different slot that correctly excluded the placed position.
- Example from R2 T13: AI had T2=[11,11,10] and drew KAPOW. T2-bottom gives direct completion [11,11,K!] → score 100+22=122. T2-middle gives KAPOW-swap completion [11,K!,10]→swap K! to top→[K!,11,10] = run → score 80+46=126 (46 included the placed KAPOW=25). Wrong: mid won over bottom.
- Fix: skip `posIdx` (the placed slot) when computing `kapowSwapExistingPoints`, matching exactly how direct completion's `existingPoints` is calculated.
- Corrected scores: T2-bottom direct=122, T2-middle swap=80+21=101. Bottom wins by ~21 — AI now correctly places KAPOW at bottom to complete T2 directly, discarding 32 pts instead of 28.

**v14 [Chuck]** Steepened discard safety penalty to prevent gifting triad-completing cards.
- Root cause from R6 T26: AI drew 8, discarded it (safety=39), score -4.2. Best placement was -4.36. A margin of only 0.16 caused the mistake — the 8 completed Chuck's [9,8,8] triad.
- New two-segment formula: above safety=50, mild positive slope `(s-50)*0.15 - 2`. Below 50, steep negative `-(50-s)*0.4 - 2`, plus extra steepness below 40: `-(40-s)*0.4`.
- safety=39 → -6.8 (was -4.2), safety=25 → -18 (was -9.5), safety=80 → +2.5 (safe discards still work).

**v13 [Chuck]** AI recognizes KAPOW-swap triad completions as offensive strategy.
- Added one-step lookahead in `aiScorePlacement`: after simulating a card placement, if the triad is all-revealed but not yet complete, try all possible within-triad KAPOW swaps. If any single swap would complete the triad, award `+80 + existingPoints` bonus (nearly as valuable as direct completion at `+100 + existingPoints`).
- Same check added to the final-turn short-circuit path.
- Updated top-position KAPOW penalty exemption to also bypass when placement completes via KAPOW swap.
- Updated action reason threshold from `ps >= 100` to `ps >= 80` so KAPOW-swap completions log as "completes Triad X".
- Example: AI had [4,10,K!] and drew 8. Mid replacement saved 2 pts (score +29). Top placement makes [8,10,K!] → swap K! to mid → ascending run [8,9,10]. Now scores ~123 and is correctly chosen.

**v12 [Chuck]** Fixed Power card modifier (+/-) values overlapping "Powerset = x" label.
- `.card-power-modifiers` repositioned to `position: absolute; bottom: 6px` so it anchors at the card bottom like fixed-card values — no longer rendered in the flex flow where it collided with the powerset label.
- `.powerset-value-on-card` raised slightly from `bottom: 26px` to `bottom: 30px` to ensure clean clearance above the modifier row.
- Result: Power cards now show "Powerset = x" in red above the +/- modifiers with no overlap.

**v11 [Chuck]** Strengthened AI discard safety scoring to prevent gifting opponent triad-completing cards.
- Root cause: discard score formula `safety * 0.05 - 2` produced a tiny range (-2 to +3). A card that directly completes an opponent triad (safety=25) only scored -0.75 — barely negative. Late in the round when placement scores also collapse, even marginal placements beat -0.75, but mediocre placements (e.g., score=-1) could lose to it, letting the AI discard a card the opponent immediately uses to win the triad.
- New formula: `(safety - 50) * 0.2 - 2` with extra penalty for safety < 30.
  - Safe discard (safety=100): +8 — chosen freely when no good placement exists
  - Neutral (safety=50): -2 — slight preference for placement over discard
  - Dangerous (safety=25): -9.5 — strongly avoids giving opponent completion cards
  - KAPOW (safety=15): -12 with extra -7.5 = -19.5 — almost never discarded
- Discard reason string now includes safety value for easier log debugging.

**v10 [Chuck]** Fixed AI hang after within-triad KAPOW swap: aiTurnInProgress never cleared.
- Root cause: `aiStepWithinTriadSwap` → `completeWithinTriadSwap` → `endTurn` bypasses `aiStepCheckSwap`, which is the only place `aiTurnInProgress = false` was set. With the guard stuck at `true`, the next AI turn could never start.
- Fix: `completeWithinTriadSwap` now sets `aiTurnInProgress = false` before `endTurn` in both the animation callback path and the else (no-animation) path.
- This is the definitive fix for the within-triad swap hang — previous fixes (v7, v9) addressed `refreshUI` ordering but missed the `aiTurnInProgress` guard.

**v9 [Chuck]** Fixed hang after AI within-triad KAPOW swap: missing refreshUI in else branch of completeWithinTriadSwap.
- Root cause: after AI's placement step discards the triad (via `checkAndDiscardTriads`), it then calls `aiStepWithinTriadSwap` → `completeWithinTriadSwap`. At this point the triad is already marked discarded, so `newlyDiscarded.length === 0` and the `else` branch fires: `endTurn(state)` with no `refreshUI()` following it. The next player's turn never triggered.
- Fix: added `refreshUI()` after `endTurn(state)` in the `else` branch, matching the animation callback path which already had this correct ordering.
- Same root cause as v7 (human path) — the else branch was missed in that fix.

**v8 [Chuck]** Fixed `aiCountFutureCompletions` to be KAPOW-aware for 3-revealed triads.
- Root cause: when scoring placement of a card into a face-down slot completing [x, K, y], `aiCountFutureCompletions([x, 25, y])` treated KAPOW as fixed value 25, finding zero paths since no set/run includes 25. This caused the 3-revealed bonus to fire as -20 (zero paths penalty) instead of rewarding the many real completion paths.
- Example: [5, K, 11] previously scored 0 future paths → -20 penalty. In reality, e.g. replacing pos 0 (5) with 9 and K=10 gives [9,10,11] ascending run — a valid path.
- Fix: `aiCountFutureCompletions` now detects when one value is 25 (KAPOW placeholder) and for each candidate replacement value, tests all 13 KAPOW assignments (0-12) to find any combination that completes the triad. Mirrors `aiAnalyzeTriad`'s existing KAPOW handling.
- Impact: placing a card into a face-down slot to create [x, K, y] now correctly scores the real completion path count, making it competitive with replacing existing revealed cards.

**v7 [Chuck]** Fixed AI not taking its turn after human within-triad KAPOW swap + discard animation.
- Root cause: in `completeWithinTriadSwap`, `refreshUI()` was called before `endTurn(state)` inside the animation callback. At that point `currentPlayer` was still the human, so the AI trigger check (`!isHumanTurn`) was false and `playAITurn` was never scheduled. After `endTurn` switched `currentPlayer` to the AI, no further `refreshUI()` was called.
- Fix: swap the order to `endTurn(state)` first, then `refreshUI()` — so when `refreshUI` runs, `currentPlayer` is already the AI and the `setTimeout(playAITurn, 1000)` fires.

**v6 [Chuck]** Fixed human within-triad KAPOW swap hanging after swap.
- After a successful swap, the game showed "Swap again, or Discard Triad and End Turn" indefinitely
- Root cause: `hasRevealedKapow` is always true (KAPOW is still in the triad, just repositioned) so the code always offered another swap instead of auto-proceeding to discard
- Fix: after the swap, check the KAPOW's new position:
  - If buried (middle or bottom) → auto-proceed to `completeWithinTriadSwap` immediately
  - If still at top (swap to buried position wasn't valid) → show "Swap again" message for one more attempt
- Mirrors the AI's one-swap-and-done logic from v5

**v5 [Chuck]** Fixed within-triad KAPOW swap: one swap, no loop; KAPOW top-position penalty exempted on triad completion.
- `aiStepWithinTriadSwap` rewritten to perform exactly one swap then immediately discard:
  - No longer recurses via `setTimeout` — eliminates any risk of infinite swap loops
  - Prefers bottom burial first, falls back to middle; takes the first valid option and stops
  - If KAPOW is already at middle or bottom (already buried), skips straight to discard
  - Swap validity still confirmed via `isTriadComplete()` simulation
  - `withinTriadSwapHistory` removed — no longer needed since only one swap is ever made
- `aiScorePlacement` defensive top-position penalty now exempted when placement completes the triad:
  - Previously a KAPOW drawn to the top slot of a completing triad incurred a -17 penalty
  - This suppressed valid triad-completing KAPOW placements at the top position
  - The penalty is unnecessary when the triad completes — the within-triad swap buries KAPOW before discard
  - New `placementCompletesTriad` flag captured during simulation and checked in the penalty block

**v4 [Chuck]** AI within-triad KAPOW swap now verified to keep triad complete; human swap validated too.
- AI `aiStepWithinTriadSwap`: replaced positional-score-only logic with simulation-based validation
  - Only attempts swaps when KAPOW is at top position (middle/bottom already buried — no action needed)
  - Simulates each candidate swap via `isTriadComplete()` before committing
  - Sets (K,x,x): swap with either position always valid — correctly confirmed
  - Runs (K,m,b): swap with bottom valid except when mid=0 (ascending) or mid=12 (descending) — correctly caught
  - Swapping K with middle in a run typically breaks it — now properly skipped
  - Still prefers deepest burial (bottom=15 > middle=10)
- Human `_onCardClick` within-triad swap: added same simulation check
  - If a swap would break the triad, shows message "That swap would break the triad! Choose a different position."
  - Prevents player from accidentally clicking an invalid target position

**v3 [Eric]** Analytics docs + SW cache bump.
- Added analytics section to CONTRIBUTING.md (events, quick checks, debug tips)
- Bumped service worker cache (v47→v48) to force fresh version for returning users
- Updated CONTRIBUTING.md to reflect changelog enforcement

**v2 [Chuck]** Debug logging for AI decision candidates and chosen actions.

**v1 [Eric]** Bug fixes + hook enforcement.
- Fixed powerset log display — stacked power modifiers now show all values (was only showing first)
- Fixed name screen button centering — How to Play / Leaderboard were left of center on desktop
- Changelog check in pre-commit hook now blocks commit (was warn-only)
- Added app icon / favicon to tech debt tracker

### 02-23-2026

**v12 [Eric]** GA4 analytics.
- Google Analytics 4 wired up with 7 custom events (game_start, tutorial_complete, round_complete, game_over, buy_cta_click, email_submit, feedback_submit)

**v11 [Eric]** Security fixes.
- XSS fix: game notes escaped via `escapeHTML()` before innerHTML
- Leaderboard score injection fix: `parseInt()` on external data
- Service worker no longer intercepts POST requests (Google Form submissions)

**v10 [Chuck]** Fixed powerset value display and improved AI powerset placement strategy.
- **Powerset display fix:** Power cards on top of other Power cards now show "Powerset = x" in red bold font (e.g., P1 on top of P2 now displays the effective value)
- **AI powerset placement strategy improvements:**
  - Added +8 bonus per KAPOW card in other positions of the same triad (recognizes opportunity for defensive swaps)
  - Added +6 positional bonus for placing powersets in top position when KAPOW burial opportunities exist
  - Example: AI placing P1 on P2 in top position now scores higher when triad also has a KAPOW, encouraging strategic positioning for future swaps
  - These changes encourage the AI to facilitate KAPOW burial through within-triad swaps after triad completion
- Fixed animation issue where within-triad KAPOW swaps followed by discard now properly animates cards disappearing one at a time

**v9 [Eric]** Developer docs.
- Added CONTRIBUTING.md — dev setup, architecture, deployment, versioning guide

**v8 [Eric]** Full changelog backfill.
- Reconstructed complete project history from initial commit (02-08) through current

**v7 [Eric]** Test suite + git hooks infrastructure.
- Added Vitest test suite: 133 tests across 7 modules (deck, hand, triad, scoring, rules, gameState, ai)
- Pre-commit hook: runs tests, auto-bumps version, enforces changelog updates
- Shared `hooks/` directory — Chuck runs `git config core.hooksPath hooks` once
- CHANGELOG.md backfilled with full project history from initial commit
- PLAN.md updated with AI improvement roadmap

**v6 [Eric]** AI KAPOW swaps, engagement hooks, merge upstream, UI polish.
- AI within-triad KAPOW swaps with oscillation prevention
- Engagement hooks: challenge-a-friend, global leaderboard (seeded, local-first)
- Powerset value display redesigned — modifiers shown on card face
- Merged upstream/master: AI KAPOW swaps, powerset value fixes
- Fixed cards showing as `?` after merge conflict (missing return)
- Pile selection says "either pile" (was only showing one option)
- Buy CTA updated for direct card sales
- UI polish: glows, badges, buttons, card spacing, loading states

**v5 [Chuck]** Fixed within-triad KAPOW swaps not detecting KAPOW in powersets.
- Critical bug extension of v4 fix: KAPOW swaps only worked when KAPOW was solo
- If AI completed a triad with KAPOW in a powerset (KAPOW + Power modifier), swaps were skipped
- Example from R1 T6: AI had [KAPOW, P1(-1)], 8, 7 and completed, but didn't attempt burial swaps
- Fixed three functions to detect KAPOW in both solo and powerset forms:
  - `hasRevealedKapow()`: Now checks `posCards.length > 0` instead of `=== 1`
  - `swapKapowCard()`: Removed `sourceCards.length !== 1` check, now allows length 1 or 2
  - `aiStepWithinTriadSwap()`: Now checks `posCards.length > 0` instead of `=== 1`
- KAPOW in powersets [KAPOW, P1] or [KAPOW, P2] are now properly detected and swappable
- Swaps move entire position: KAPOW alone OR KAPOW+modifier as a unit

**v4 [Chuck]** Fixed AI within-triad KAPOW swaps not triggering on triad completion.
- Critical bug: AI would complete a triad with a revealed KAPOW and immediately discard it
- Example from R4 T4: AI placed a card completing a triad with KAPOW in top position
- Instead of swapping KAPOW to middle/bottom to bury it, AI discarded triad, leaving KAPOW on discard pile
- Root cause: Within-triad KAPOW swap phase only enabled for human player (currentPlayer === 0)
- Fixed three placement handlers to enable within-triad swaps for both human and AI:
  - `handlePlaceCard()`: check for KAPOW + completion regardless of player
  - `handleAddPowerset()`: same fix for Power card modifier placements
  - `handleCreatePowersetOnPower()`: same fix for powerset creation
- Now AI strategically buries KAPOW cards before triad discard, matching human player capability

**v3 [Chuck]** Reverted incorrect Power card scoring fix.
- Power cards were briefly treated as scoring 0 points (incorrect)
- Reverted: Power cards correctly score their face value (1 for P1, 2 for P2)
- This was causing R1 T8 bug where P1 in completed triad incorrectly had 0 value
- Correct scoring: solo Power = face value; in powerset = face + modifier

**v2 [Chuck]** Implemented AI within-triad KAPOW swaps with oscillation prevention.
- AI now performs strategic within-triad KAPOW swaps when completing triads
- Evaluates all three positions and selects optimal burial depth (bottom > middle > top)
- Adds bonus for moving KAPOW away from exposed top position
- Prevents oscillation by tracking swap history (never swaps KAPOW back to previous position)
- Includes detailed explanation in "Understand AI's Move" modal showing swap strategy
- AI recursively swaps KAPOW deeper until no better position is available
- After within-triad swaps complete, proceeds to discard triad and cross-triad KAPOW swaps

- Version counter resets to v1 for new date
- All changes from 02-21-2026 carried forward

- PLAN.md added as living project document

### 02-21-2026

**v10 [Eric]** Fix desktop piles tucked in: replaced CSS grid with flex+center on play-area.
- `grid-template-columns: auto 1fr auto` made center column claim full viewport width, pushing piles to screen edges
- New: `display: flex; justify-content: center` — piles sit directly adjacent to cards
- `#center-strip` uses `align-self: stretch` to lock width to hand-grid

**v9 [Eric]** Fix desktop vertical spacing: remove artificial spreading between hands and center strip.
- Card formula overhead increased 165px → 280px to account for center strip + headers
- Removed fixed height from hands-column, removed `flex: 1` from center-strip
- Cards top out at ~103px on 900px viewports (still reach 130px at ≥1060px)

**v8 [Eric]** Fix desktop center strip button layout: each element on its own row.
- Message, action buttons (Hint + End Turn), and Understand AI's Move each occupy a full-width row
- `flex: 0 0 100%` enforces single-row-per-element — no horizontal shifting

**v7 [Eric]** Fix piles shifting horizontally and version to footer center.
- CSS grid (`auto 1fr auto`) locks piles in fixed columns
- Center strip uses `width: fit-content; margin: auto`
- Revision footer moved from bottom-right to bottom-center

**v6 [Eric]** Stack center strip vertically: message on its own row, buttons below.
- `flex-wrap: wrap` on center-strip, `flex: 0 0 100%` on game-message

**v5 [Eric]** Fix desktop card overflow: viewport-height-based card sizing.
- Formula: `clamp(68px, (100vh - 165px) / 6, 130px)` — 6 card rows fill available height
- Card width derives from height at fixed 100:140 aspect ratio
- Renamed VERSION_LOG.md → CHANGELOG.md

**v4 [Eric]** Merged Eric's fork: mobile UI, sounds, animations, tutorial, PWA, bug fixes.
- Mobile-first responsive layout (CSS grid, svh/dvh units, iOS Safari viewport lock)
- PWA / iOS home screen app (manifest.json, service worker, Apple meta tags)
- Sound effects via Web Audio API (flip, draw, place, triad chime, KAPOW hit, round/game end)
- Card animations (3D flip on reveal, slide-in on placement, screen shake on triad, KAPOW glow)
- Interactive tutorial — first game uses stacked deck with coaching messages; replayable from Help
- "How to Play" modal with 5 tabs (Basics, Cards, Turns, Scoring, Tips) + YouTube link
- Hint button — AI-powered best-move suggestion
- "Understand AI's Move" lightbulb tips — contextual strategic insights in explanation modal
- AI banter shown above AI hand on mobile
- Cached player name via localStorage; welcome-back message on return
- TOP row label on first triad for orientation
- XSS fix: player name sanitized with escapeHTML()
- AI deadlock fix: empty draw + discard pile no longer silently freezes the game
- Scoring null guard: applyFirstOutPenalty no longer crashes when nobody went out
- Doubling penalty explanation on round-end screen
- Also merged Chuck's AI fixes: going-out-via-triad-completion detection,
  matched-pair destruction penalty, stronger discard safety (0.4× → 1.0×),
  draw-from-discard going-out guard

**v3 [Chuck]** Redesigned powerset value display to appear directly on card.
- Powerset values now display on the fixed value card instead of below it
- Format: "Powerset = X" where X is the total value (card + all modifiers)
- Orange font (#ff9800), 14px, bold, centered above card bottom
- Prevents card layout shift caused by below-card powerset info
- Cleaner UI with improved readability for powerset values
- Removed individual modifier display and calculation details

**v2 [Chuck]** Removed frozen KAPOW property (deprecated feature).
- KAPOW cards are never frozen; this feature was removed from game long ago
- Cleaned up all references to isFrozen and assignedValue properties
- Simplified KAPOW checks from 'type === kapow && !isFrozen' to 'type === kapow'
- Removed triad freezing logic and KAPOW reset when discarded
- Code now reflects actual game mechanics where KAPOW is always wild (0-12)

**v1 [Chuck]** Implemented within-triad KAPOW swaps for strategic card positioning.
- When a placement completes a triad containing a revealed KAPOW, player can now swap it within that triad before discard
- Prevents KAPOW from being immediately exposed on the discard pile's top position
- New swap phase enters after placement but before triad discard
- Button text changes to "Discard Triad and End Turn" during within-triad swap phase
- Message box highlights with swap-phase styling
- New helper functions: `hasRevealedKapow()`, `completeWithinTriadSwap()`
- Modified `findSwapTargets()` with optional scope restriction parameter
- AI unchanged: uses normal cross-triad swap logic after discard

### 02-20-2026

**v3 [Chuck]** Fixed AI explanation to avoid nonsensical future completion paths when going out.
- When placement triggers going out, explanation now focuses on going-out decision
- Removed mention of "completion paths" that will never be needed post-game
- Explanation now clarifies why the timing was right to end the round

**v2 [Chuck]** Strengthened discard safety penalty for opponent-completion cards.
- Increased scaling factor for replaced-card discard penalty from 0.4 to 1.0
- Penalty now directly proportional to danger level (stronger deterrent)
- Prevents AI from discarding cards that would help opponent complete triads
- Example: replacing 9 with 3 now scores -2 instead of +3 when 9 completes opponent's triad

**v1 [Chuck]** Initial revision with software revision footer added.
- Added revision footer to lower right corner of page
- Format: `02-20-2026 v1` (date v{version})
- Created VERSION_LOG.md for version tracking
