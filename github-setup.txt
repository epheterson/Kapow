KAPOW! Game — GitHub Setup Steps
==================================

STEP 1: Create a GitHub Account (skip if you already have one)
---------------------------------------------------------------
Go to: https://github.com
Click "Sign up" and follow the prompts.


STEP 2: Create a New Repository on GitHub
------------------------------------------
1. Log in to GitHub.
2. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner → "New repository"
3. Fill in:
   - Repository name: kapow-game  (or whatever you prefer)
   - Description: KAPOW! card game — browser-based learning tool
   - Visibility: Public  (so testers can access it without an account)
   - Do NOT check "Add a README", "Add .gitignore", or "Choose a license"
     (the local repo already has these)
4. Click "Create repository"
5. GitHub will show a page with setup commands. Copy your repository URL —
   it will look like: https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/kapow-game.git


STEP 3: Connect the Local Repo to GitHub
------------------------------------------
Open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) and run these commands,
replacing YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username:

   cd "E:\OneDrive\Documents\Chuck\Claude\kapow-game"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/kapow-game.git
   git branch -M master
   git push -u origin master

GitHub will prompt you to log in if you haven't already.


STEP 4: Share the Link
------------------------
Once pushed, your shareable link will be:

   https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/kapow-game

Testers can open the game directly in their browser via GitHub Pages
(see STEP 5), or they can download/clone the repo and open index.html.


STEP 5 (Optional): Enable GitHub Pages so testers can play in-browser
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. On your GitHub repo page, click "Settings"
2. In the left sidebar, click "Pages"
3. Under "Branch", select "master" and folder "/ (root)", then click Save.
4. After a minute, the game will be live at:

   https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/kapow-game/

Share that URL and testers can play instantly — no download needed.
