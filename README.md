## How to Play

KAPOW! is played over **10 rounds**. Lowest total score wins.

### The Cards (118 total)

| Type | Count | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Fixed** | 96 | Values 0–12. Lower is better. |
| **Power** | 16 | Modifiers (±1 or ±2) that stack on existing cards to change their value |
| **KAPOW!** | 6 | Wild cards — assign any value 0–12 to complete a triad. **25-point penalty** if left unresolved |

### Setup

Each player gets 12 cards arranged in **4 triads** (columns of 3). All start face-down. You reveal 2 cards to start.

### On Your Turn

1. **Draw** from the deck or discard pile
2. **Place** the card in your hand (swapping out an existing card) or **discard** it
3. Power cards can be **stacked** as modifiers beneath existing cards
4. KAPOW! cards can be **swapped** between positions after placement

### Triad Completion

When all 3 cards in a triad form a **set** (same value) or a **run** (consecutive sequence), the triad is **discarded for zero points**. This is how you win — eliminate entire columns from your score.

### Going Out

When all your cards are revealed or discarded, the round ends. All other players get one final turn. **Warning:** if you go out first but don't have the lowest score, your score is **doubled**.

### Scoring

- Remaining cards score their face value (modified by any Power cards)
- Completed triads score 0
- Unplaced KAPOW! cards score 25
- First-out penalty: score doubled if not strictly lowest

## Architecture

Single-file IIFE bundle (`js/kapow.js`, ~192KB unminified):

| Section | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| AI Banter | 100+ contextual messages across 17 categories |
| Deck/Hand | Card creation, Fisher-Yates shuffle, deal, hand management |
| Triads | Completion detection: sets, runs, KAPOW value assignment |
| Scoring | Hand evaluation, first-out doubling penalty, winner determination |
| Game State | State machine: setup → firstTurn → playing → finalTurns → scoring → gameOver |
| AI Engine | Multi-layered heuristic evaluation with opponent modeling |
| UI | DOM rendering, modals, animations, scorecard |
| Tutorial | Stacked-deck onboarding: triads, power cards, KAPOW mechanics |
| Action Log | Turn-by-turn history with text export |

### The AI

The AI opponent evaluates every possible action each turn:

- **Placement scoring** — value delta, triad completion potential, synergy with revealed cards, KAPOW timing
- **Opponent threat modeling** — tracks near-complete triads, reveal ratio, estimated score
- **Discard safety analysis** — avoids feeding cards that complete your triads
- **Matched-pair protection** — won't break a valuable matched pair for a small raw gain
- **Go-out timing** — considers hand value, unrevealed count, doubled-score risk
- **Triad completion going-out detection** — simulates whether completing a triad triggers going out with a bad score
