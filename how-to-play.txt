KAPOW! — How to Play
=====================

This is the text shown in the in-app "How to Play" modal.
Chuck: edit this file with any changes you'd like, and Eric
will update the app to match.

The modal has 5 tabs: Basics, Cards, Turns, Scoring, Tips.


== TAB: BASICS ==

--- Goal ---
Have the fewest points after 10 rounds. Cards in your hand
count against you — get rid of them by completing triads.

--- Setup ---
Each player gets 12 cards face-down arranged in 4 columns
of 3 (called "triads"). The remaining cards form a draw pile,
with one card face-up starting the discard pile.

--- What's a Triad? ---
Each column of 3 cards is a triad. Complete a triad and it
gets discarded for 0 points. A triad is complete when it
contains:

  - Three of a kind — same value in all 3 positions
    (e.g. 7, 7, 7)
  - A run — three consecutive values
    (e.g. 5, 6, 7 or 10, 11, 12)

== TAB: CARDS ==

--- The Deck (118 cards) ---

FIXED CARDS (96):
Values 0-12. Eight of each (except 1 and 2 which have four
each). Simple — the number on the card is its value.

POWER CARDS (16):
Have a face value (1 or 2) plus modifier values (+/-1 or
+/-2). Play them alone for face value, or stack under another
card to modify that position's value. Stacked cards form a
"powerset" — they move as a unit.

KAPOW! CARDS (6):
Wild cards (value 0-12). Worth +25 points until used in a
triad. Once placed, you can swap their position with any
other card until they're frozen in a completed triad or
powerset.


== TAB: TURNS ==

--- First Turn ---
Reveal any 2 cards in your hand (click them). Then draw a
card and play it.

--- Each Turn After ---
1. Draw — click the draw pile or discard pile to pick up
   a card
2. Play it — either:
   - Discard it — click the discard pile
   - Replace a card — click any card in your hand (the old
     card goes to discard)
   - Create a powerset — stack it on a face-up power card
3. Any completed triads are automatically discarded
4. You may swap a free KAPOW! card with another card in
   your hand

--- Going Out ---
When all your cards are revealed or discarded, the round
ends. Each other player gets one final turn (all hidden
cards are revealed first).


== TAB: SCORING ==

--- Round Scoring ---
- Completed triads = 0 points (already discarded)
- Incomplete triads = sum of card values in each position
- Unused KAPOW! = +25 points each
- KAPOW! in a powerset = value of the powerset, not 25
- Power cards in a powerset use their modifier values

--- Going-Out Penalty ---
If you go out first but don't have the lowest score, your
score for that round is doubled. Going out is risky — make
sure you're actually winning!

--- After 10 Rounds ---
Lowest total score wins.


== TAB: TIPS ==

--- Quick Tips ---
- Complete high-value triads first — getting rid of 12s
  early is better than perfecting 3s
- Build triads with multiple outs — a triad with 9, 9,
  and 11 can be completed by drawing 9, 10, or a KAPOW!
- Power cards can make negative values — a -2 power under
  a 0 = -2 points. Keep those!
- Watch the discard pile — when you complete a triad, its
  top card becomes available to your opponent
- Don't go out too early — if Kai has a lower score, yours
  gets doubled
- KAPOW! cards are flexible — swap them around to where
  they're needed most before they get frozen

--- Use "Understand Kai's Move" ---
After Kai plays, click the "Understand Kai's Move" button
to see the reasoning. Great way to learn advanced strategy.
